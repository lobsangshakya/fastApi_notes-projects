# FastAPI Learning Journey

Welcome to my comprehensive FastAPI learning repository! This collection contains detailed notes with practical examples to master FastAPI development from basics to advanced concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- **Core Concepts**: Understand FastAPI's architecture and design philosophy
- **HTTP Mastery**: Learn proper status codes, request/response handling, and error management
- **Async Programming**: Master asynchronous operations and concurrency patterns
- **Security**: Implement secure authentication and protect sensitive data
- **Validation**: Use Pydantic models for robust input/output validation
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for reliable APIs

## Repository Structure

- **`notes/`**: Detailed notes on FastAPI internals, HTTP semantics, security concepts, and best practices
