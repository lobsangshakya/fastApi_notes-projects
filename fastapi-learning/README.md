# FastAPI Learning Repository

Welcome to my FastAPI learning journey! This repository contains notes, projects, and scripts to help master FastAPI development.

## Learning Goals

- Understand FastAPI's core concepts and architecture
- Learn how to build robust APIs with proper error handling
- Master asynchronous programming with FastAPI
- Implement dependency injection effectively
- Write comprehensive tests for API endpoints
- Deploy FastAPI applications in production environments

## Repository Structure

- **notes/**: Theoretical concepts, explanations, and key learnings about FastAPI internals
- **projects/**: Hands-on projects and exercises to practice FastAPI skills
- **scripts/**: Helper scripts for development and testing

## Getting Started

1. Install the global dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Navigate to any project directory and run:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Progress Tracking

This repository serves as a living document of my FastAPI learning journey. Each note and project represents milestones in understanding various aspects of the framework.
